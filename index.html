            <div class = "message">
                <p>Memory is an innate quality of living matter. Right from Amoeba, the living kingdom adopted unique ways to store memory. It started with the code in the DNA and we humans operate solely based on memory. Even the stuff that is done subconsciously has muscle memory built into the action. It may be safe say that memory and human existence cannot be separated from one another. But recently there is a shift in that thinking with the advent of machines that store memory for us. And we are pushing things too far out. Our capacity to recall is getting blunted out. We donot have to remember the routes that we need to take and do not have to remember the very important dates and likewise do not have to remember a lot of personal things that define us as human beings. Memories both sweet and sour make our lives complete. The fact that we are going against the very idea as to how we morphed ourselves as humans is very worrisome. It is terrible that we just cannot exist without our phones</p>
                <p>Time has come when we have to take back our lives and do something logical. Our small and humble quest into creation of this memory game/ competition is to provide a small platform for kids and adults to exercise and repair their brains termed Neuroplasticity from the damage due to excessive dependence on Mobile phones. Just imagine how nice it would be to again hum to the beautiful music: Yes it can be played on your mobile. The essence is to use oneâ€™s mobile to enhance their memory not to lose it.</p>
                <p>This program or competition is created so that the recent and short term memory can be honed by improving the concentration and attention span. Our effort is to bring out the best in the students and those in the workforce. This will improve the ability to concentrate and may ultimately improve the overall performance of both students and the workforce.</p>
                <p>We invite students, parents, and adults of all ages to try this competition. Our sentences are structured to make this a fun experience. This is so much different form Spelling bee in that the participants do not need to spend hours preparing for the competition. We think that this may actually improve the performance of students if their school day starts with a few minutes of this competition.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>The memory team</p>
